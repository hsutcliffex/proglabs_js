# Practical: git collaboration

## Aims

* Familiarisation with git for collaboration
* Team work

## Tasks

1. Make a group of three or four with other people in your practical session. If you need help to find group members ask the demonstrators. 

2. Choose one person in the group to create a repository, and then to [add the other group members as collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects#managing-access-for-user-level-projects). Other group members should then clone the newly created repo

   
3. Develop a set of web pages describing applications of computing that make positive contributions  to society, linking with each other and to external pages where relevant. Include an index page and navigation links between the pages.

4. The pages should use a consistent theme based on a web framework such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

5. Each page should be authored by one group member, with author details included but written by somebody else. Include links to the author's github pages and linkedin profile where appropriate. The university has some [guidance on using linkedin](https://durham.careercentre.me/clientcontent/qPAqQydbXP6021ueTw5wnw/files/Help%20Sheets/LinkedIn.docx).

6. Once you have a good set of pages you can release them by pushing them to gitpages
